<!-- The code point U+25CC for key label is needed because the font rendering system prior to
     API version 16 can't automatically render dotted circle for incomplete combining letter
     of some scripts. The files named res/xml/key_*.xml have this U+25CC hack, although the
     counterpart files named res/xml-v16/key_*.xml don't have this hack. -->
